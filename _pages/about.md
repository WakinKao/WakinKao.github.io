I am a Ph.D candidate at University of Texas at Austin, specialized in quantitative methods and family dynamic (i.e., fathering, cross-generational parenting, and parenting). In my research, I explored the best practice for child development in three generational families through mixed-methods (i.e., observation and model building). Also, I explored how fathers convey their beliefs of education to offspring and how fathers perceived the role of father through qualitative methods (e.g., interview). Meanwhile, I believe in the power of collective influence of families, communities, and schools on children/adolescents' development. In my most recent work, I explored how the cumulative effects of the immediate environment that children/adolescents live in impact their well-being through analyzing data from national secondary databases (e.g., ABCD, NSCH). In the meantime, I am interested in Education Policy and its impact on students' academic development.

# 📊 Portfolio
### 1. Descriptive and Factor Analysis with R (n=575)
This work is the final project of the course "Data Visualization in R". Codes were written using R Markdown. Packages were used included tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, car, lavaan, etc.. This final project tried to answer the following research questions: 1) Do college students of different gender feel a different level of loneliness? 2) Do college students of different genders present different attitudes toward aloneness? 3. Do perceived parenting styles during childhood and adolescence relate to their perceived loneliness from parents and peers? Data analysis Methods include 1) Descriptive Analysis, 2) Pearson Correlation, 3) independent sample t-test, and 4) Psychometrics analysis.

### 2. 2022-2023 New Student Orientation with Tableau

### 3. College of Education Signature Impact Area Evaluation with Tableau (n=518)
College of Education (COE) at the University of Texas at Austin aims to prepare future educators, leaders, and researchers to tackle impactful issues that face today’s students to positively transform lives. To achieve the goal, COE focuses on three strategic impact areas: advancing equitable opportunities and addressing disparities in education and health; attending to place and context; and thriving through transitions. This project strives to provide an intuitive view of the impact of the three strategic impact areas.
