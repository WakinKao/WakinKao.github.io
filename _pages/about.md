I am a Ph.D candidate at University of Texas at Austin, specialized in quantitative methods and family dynamic (i.e., fathering, cross-generational parenting, and parenting). In my research, I explored the best practice for child development in three generational families through mixed-methods (i.e., observation and model building). Also, I explored how fathers convey their beliefs of education to offspring and how fathers perceived the role of father through qualitative methods (e.g., interview). Meanwhile, I believe in the power of collective influence of families, communities, and schools on children/adolescents' development. In my most recent work, I explored how the cumulative effects of the immediate environment that children/adolescents live in impact their well-being through analyzing data from national secondary databases (e.g., ABCD, NSCH).
